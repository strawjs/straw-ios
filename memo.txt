straw-ios-http-service
straw-ios-http-service.js

----

A service can be either stateful or stateless.
That's why the naming of `Straw Service Method`.
Reusable services should be most likely stateless.
Application specific services can be stateful.


Service - a bundle of series of functions.
Service Method - a functionality of a service.
Service Call - a call of Service Method.
Service Call Context - a context of a call of Service Method

Service Repository - repository of services
Service Call Factory - factory of service call object

----

The Domain Services should never touch the Application layer.
(But specific service implementations can touch the application layey,
because they are half-application.)

Do people really want stateful services?
